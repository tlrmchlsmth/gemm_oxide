# momms

Introduction
------------

MOMMS is a sandbox for implementing algorithms for matrix-matrix multiplicaiton (MMM) written in Rust.
Algorithms are instantiated via type composition.

How-to
------
Get Rust Nightly:
[https://www.rustup.rs/]

Install BLIS to your home directory:
[https://github.com/flame/blis]

Get and install hwloc:
[https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/]
On Ubuntu:
    apt-get install libhwloc-dev

Install libclang (for bindgen to automatically generate bindings to BLIS)
    apt-get install llvm-3.9-dev libclang-3.9-dev clang-3.9

To build MOMMS binaries in release using the blis kernel:
    cargo build --release --features "blis hsw"
